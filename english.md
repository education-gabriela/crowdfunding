### From Small Project to Startup

A long while ago now, I wrote a system that could take what you listen to via Last.fm and post it to Twitter. At the time, I wasn't aware of the already existing Tweekly.fm service that was created by Simon de la Rouviere . I spoke to Simon and took over the running of the service using my new codebase - this allowed the service to grow from a few thousand users to the nearly half a million we have today.

To date, Tweekly.fm has sent just over 24 million updates to social networks.
There have been a lot of headaches, server meltdowns and all night coding sessions to keep the service going over the past few years and I spent a large part of my vacation this time rewriting the service from the ground up. As you can imagine, this hasn't been an easy task but it's been one that is well worth it.

The aim now, is to turn Tweekly.fm into a fully fledged startup along with a new site and both Apple iOS and Android apps. This funding will allow for the remaining development to be done and for the apps to be commissioned.

### Why not paid apps and subscription accounts?
The original plan was to allow previous donating users a premium account, this will still be honoured and those accounts will be set to allow more connected to services than the standard accounts. There will also be an system of badges for users that will be in place to denote those who have helped the service survive for this long.

In the early years of service, we were provided server space by Last.fm but as the number of users got bigger and bigger, this wasn't a good solution. This means that the hosting bill came down to me personally and I've backed the project financially since.

The idea of the crowd funding venture here is that if the project goal is met, the first version of all mobile apps that are written will be free of charge for Apple iOS and Android and all adverts will be removed from the site - apart from the Sponsor Perk ones.

In the long term, I do believe that charging for apps will provide a sustainable revenue model for the project. It'll be fun to see what the future brings.
